# === Silent Void ===
### ~Tech Demo v.0.1.2 - Hotfix 2
This is a very early preview demo of my newest game,
Silent Void. You are intended to see almost nothing. By sending a "ping," you get a low-resolution map of your surroundings, but it is limited to only one frame. I will add an entity that you can only see by "pinging" it.

Move around with "WASD" or the arrow keys. Send a "ping" using "SPACE," and run by holding "C."
You can temporarily show and hide the map with "M."
